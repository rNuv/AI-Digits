# AI-Digits
A React-Flask Web App that implements my Neural Network library with the MNIST database of handwritten digits.

## Summary ðŸ˜„
For my Independent Study - AI Class, I decided to interface with the neural network library I created in Python through a web application. The application lets you draw a digit and feed that to a trained neural network. It attempts to classify what digit you drew. The results were... decentðŸ˜¬ .Turns out passing stringified image data to a back end is harder than it looks. 

## Tech ðŸ’»
The UI is done with React and Material-UI. It was my first attempt at learning it so I was pretty happy with the results.
